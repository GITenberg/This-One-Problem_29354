<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">Marc Polder</span>, Resident Comptroller
of Torran, strolled idly
down the dusty littered path that
passed for a street. In the half-light
of the pint-sized moon overhead
the town looked almost romantic.
One day, when civilization
had at last been brought to these
Asteroid bases, memory would
make Torran heroic. But now,
with the fact before the eyes, it
was merely dirty and squalid.
Only the scum of the Solar System
called it home.</p>

<p>Idly Marc Polder pushed a
swinging door aside and entered
what passed on Torran for a
restaurant. Pushing his way
through the tables until he saw his
only aide, Female Personnel
Manager Lee Treynor, he sat
down.</p>

<p>"What's new?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not a thing." But for a certain
softness of voice and curve of unmade-up
lips, Lee could have
passed for a boy. Her light hair
was short, she wore a man's
coveralls. She added, "Only the
usual murder, arson and brigandage
that you don't want to hear
about."</p>

<p>"Don't let such trifles get you
down," said Marc with a crooked
half-smile.</p>

<p>"I'm fed up," the girl said
shortly. "I must have been still
wet behind the ears when I agreed
to come out here two months ago.
I thought I was going to help
establish a place where decent
people could live and work. So
far I've just watched my boss
swig Venerian swamp beer with
the worst elements in town, and
do nothing about the lawlessness
that runs riot all over the place."</p>

<p>"Look, lady," Marc answered
gently, "I certainly admire those
lofty sentiments of yours. I admit
they are maybe what ought to be.
But the way I see it they just
don't fit the facts. Out here the
Federation space fleet is supposed
to be the big stick. Only right
now it's off playing mumbly-peg
with the Venerians.</p>

<p>"The Big Wheels seem to think
there'll be a shooting war in a
couple of months. There's only
three or four destroyers left in
the whole damn Asteroid Belt.
And without the big stick behind
me I'm not hankering to commit
suicide by looking for trouble."</p>

<p>Marc smiled again ruefully.
"What I can do I try to do," he
added with sudden earnestness.
"I figure the most important thing
is to protect the Asteroid Development
Company so they can
buy the nuclear ore the Astrodites
bring in. Without that ore the
Federation's going to be in a hell
of a fix if it actually does come
to war. And along with that
there's the matter of guarding the
stuff the Navy's got stored here."
He waved toward the Navy warehouse
that could be seen outside
the window.</p>

<p>"Listening to and fraternizing
with the characters you call the
biggest crooks in town," the comptroller
went on with a shrug, "I've
a chance at getting tipped off in
advance to anything that may
make trouble for our interests. As
long as I ignore their rackets they
accept me in their midst, talk
freely with me around. And it's a
hell of a lot easier to stop something
when you know the score
beforehand."</p>

<p>The young woman's lips parted
as if she seemed about to say
something. Then they closed in a
thin line. Obviously she was not
happy with Marc Polder's explanation.
She was too young to
be willing to compromise her
ideals, no matter how potent the
logic of necessity.</p>

<p>She was about to leave the
table when the shrill screams of a
distant whistle sliced through the
noise of the crowd. Voices broke
off in mid-sentence and bodies
froze into immobility. As the
siren's piercing tones faded the
restaurant's customers looked at
one another in silent terror. Then,
as the shock wore off and unanswered
questions were beginning
to fly, a man suddenly ran
in through the revolving doors.</p>

<p>"Raiders!" he gasped. "The
listening gear's picked up a signal
that's not from any Astrodite or
destroyer. Signal Corps figures it's
a pirate!"</p>

<p>There was a mad rush for the
doors and seconds later the place
was empty except for Marc
Polder, still sitting calmly at the
table drinking his beer, and Lee
Treynor who sat watching him.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"
she finally asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know. What <i>can</i> I
do?" Marc said.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" the girl exploded.
"Are you just going to
sit there guzzling beer while
pirates take over the town?" She
stared at him incredulously.</p>

<p>"What do you suggest I do?"
the comptroller asked. "We
haven't anything to fight with.
There's no way we can get help.
As far as I can see there's nothing
we <i>can</i> do&mdash;not yet anyway." He
calmly lifted his glass.</p>

<p>"You mean we're just going to
<i>sit</i> here?" the girl gaped.</p>

<p>"Sure. The others left to hide
their money and valuables. I've
got nothing to hide."</p>

<p>"What about that stuff the
Navy has cached in their warehouse?"
Lee asked. "That new
rocket fuel their destroyers use
when they need a little extra push.
Isn't that worth hiding?"</p>

<p>"The hyper-degenerate-thorium,
you mean? I'd like to hide that
somewhere," Marc conceded.
"But where do you hide ten tons
of stuff in five minutes? Besides,
it wouldn't do the raiders any
good. Too hot. It'll burn out
their jets. They'd go up like an
A-bomb two minutes after they
threw it on. They know that.
Only thing they could do with it
is sell it to Venus. Not that that
would be bad. Shortage of
H.D.T.'s may be the chief reason
why there's been no war started
yet. But for now there's nothing
you and I can do." Calmly he lit
a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Of course," he went on, smiling,
"we <i>could</i> bum a ride out
with some of the company men.
No doubt they're all hightailing
it away from here in their space-buggies."</p>

<p>"I'm surprised," Lee said with
a trace of sarcasm, "that you're
not doing just that, leaving me
and the other women to the
beasts!"</p>

<p>Marc eyed her unblinkingly.
"You know as well as I do that
most of the females on this
asteroid take pirates in their stride.
They might even welcome a
change of partners. As for you"&mdash;he
paused&mdash;"you stick close to
me and keep your pretty mouth
shut. I think we'll manage somehow."</p>

<p>In silence they walked back to
the comptroller's office.</p>

<p>"Marc," Lee said as they
entered, "what about the new
radar? Maybe we could get a
message out with it, in code or
something."</p>

<p>"What?" Marc turned, astonished.
"You want to play our
only hole-card on an off-chance
like that? There aren't more than
four or five people here who even
know it's been set up on the other
side of the asteroid. There's
hardly a chance the raiders will
find out about it. And you want
to blast the news at them!" He
looked disgusted.</p>

<p>The girl said stubbornly, "You
can't just give up without a fight.
And that's our only weapon."</p>

<p>"Look," Marc said grimly,
"that's only a second-hand
destroyer radar, so it wouldn't
carry far. No. I'm not going to
use it on any such harebrained
scheme as that. And if you
breathe a word about it I'll take
you apart." He added with a
faint smile, "Not that <i>that</i>
wouldn't be a pleasure."</p>

<p>Looking at him she knew he
meant the tender joke and the
knowledge helped her.</p>

<p>"I think," Marc went on after
a moment, "I'd better warn the
boys over on the radar project or
they might accidentally start it up
while the raiders are here." He
closed the door as he went into
the inner office to make the call.</p>

<p>A moment later he emerged and
studied the still angry girl through
half-closed eyes. She blushed
under his scrutiny, said coldly,
"What's the matter? Afraid I'm
not attractive enough for our
visitors?"</p>

<p>He grinned. "You could do
with a mite of padding here and
there. But I was thinking the
other way, as a matter of fact. It's
a pity you don't have a small
mustache."</p>

<p>"You don't have to insult me!"
Lee cried bitterly. "I'm <i>glad</i> I'm
thin!"</p>

<p>"I'm not insulting you," Marc
said mildly. "I even wish you
were a bit skinnier. It's the plump
girls our guests are going to be
looking at first. Remember now&mdash;you
stick right with me and
keep your mouth shut, d'you
hear?"</p>

<p>"I hear," she said shortly. But
he could see the fear she was
trying to hide and he knew she
was honestly frightened for the
first time in her adult life. She
said, "What will they&mdash;be like?"</p>

<p>"If it's John Mantor, and I
suspect it is, they'll be rough,"
Marc informed her. "He's a tough
ex-pilot who got bounced off
Space Patrol and turned outlaw.
He seems to hold a grudge
against the whole human race.
If it's one of the others&mdash;it may
be a lot worse."</p>

<p>"I don't see why outlaws are
allowed to exist at all," she said.</p>

<p>Marc sighed, shook his head.
"A lot of people have felt that
way over a lot of pirates over a
lot of eras. But somehow they
keep turning up."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the space-scarred
pirate ship had made a
rocky landing in the middle of the
small spaceport and John Mantor,
pirate chief, drove up to the comptroller's
office in a cloud of dust.
He was tall and dirty and thin and
tough. "Which one of you is the
comptroller?" he demanded, as
he faced Marc Polder and Lee
Treynor.</p>

<p>"I am," Marc said, not rising
from behind the desk.</p>

<p>"Then you're the guy responsible
for any trouble here," Mantor
said. "So I'm going to tell you
how to avoid trouble." His
brutally scarred face twisted into
a grin.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of loot around
here. I'm not going to ask you
where it is. My boys can take
care of that matter. But there's
also the Navy warehouse. Maybe
we won't know what some of the
stuff in there is for, so you're
going to tell us."</p>

<p>Mantor leaned across the desk,
his eyes as hard and cold as
chips of duratite. "And if you
won't, there's going to be trouble
and you'll be it&mdash;you and your
friend here."</p>

<p>Marc sat impassively, meeting
the hard-eyed gaze. "That warehouse
is government property,"
he said. "So far, there's only
piracy against you. But if you
raid that building you're going
to be the personal problem of the
Navy. If I were you I'd leave it
alone."</p>

<p>"You let me worry about that,"
said Mantor.</p>

<p>"Besides," Marc went on, "I
don't see what good the stuff in
that warehouse can be to you.
There's little of cash value in
there. And I doubt if you can
use any of the parts on your ship."</p>

<p>"That could be," Mantor replied.
"But on the other hand,
maybe we can find a market for
certain items." He smiled coldly.
Watching, Lee knew he referred
to Venus. She sat perfectly still,
praying for him not to notice her.</p>

<p>Mantor spread his hands on the
desk, a look of hatred and ferocity
on his face. "What I want to
know is&mdash;are you or are you not
going to cooperate? And I want
to know fast."</p>

<p>"Don't get me wrong," Marc
said softly. "I'm not telling you
what to do or what not to do.
But that warehouse is the thing
I'm here to protect. And if I were
to agree to help you, the Navy
would be after me, too. So I've
got to say to hell with you."</p>

<p>John Mantor rocked back on
his heels, hooking his thumbs in
his belt. A slow smile spread
over his face. "Okay," he said. "I
think I get what you mean. So I
guess we got to work you over.
And we'll do it where there aren't
any outside witnesses."</p>

<p>Marc grinned back at him.</p>

<p>Lee was puzzled. It took her
a moment to realize that the grins
sealed a contract between the two
men. Marc would cooperate if he
were beaten up enough first to
satisfy a later investigation&mdash;but
not too severely for his own comfort!</p>

<p>Lee found it difficult to hide
her contempt. She stared at her
hands, clenched in her lap, and
waited for Mantor to leave.</p>

<p>The looting and destruction
were well under way an hour later
when a couple of Mantor's men
joined their chief, who stood with
a somewhat bruised Marc Polder
and an unharmed but furious Lee
Treynor. Between them they carried
a small, obviously heavy box.</p>

<p>"You know what this stuff is,
boss?" one of the men asked.
"They got a hundred or a
hundred-fifty boxes like this in
there." He nodded at the Navy
warehouse.</p>

<p>They set the box down and
Mantor flung back its lid. It was
filled with small grey pellets.
Mantor picked up a handful and
stood fingering them.</p>

<p>"Looks like rocket fuel," he
said. "Only I've never seen any
this color. And it's too heavy,
also." He turned to the comptroller.
"<i>You</i> tell me what it is."</p>

<p>Marc shrugged. "I don't know.
It's a Navy secret."</p>

<p>Mantor's eyes glinted. Without
warning his fist flew out, sent the
comptroller sprawling in the dust
where he lay stunned. Lee's hands
flew to her mouth barely in time
to suppress a cry.</p>

<p>After a few moments Marc
rolled over slowly and pushed
himself painfully to a sitting position.
He looked up at Mantor who
stood watching him coldly, his
fist flexing.</p>

<p>The comptroller licked his lips
and looked around at the several
men who stood watching, their
faces impassive. "Okay," he said
in a none-too-steady voice. "I'll
tell you. You'd find out anyway
from the files."</p>

<p>"Cut the alibis and give," Mantor
growled.</p>

<p>"Keep your shirt on." Marc's
voice indicated he was regaining
control of himself. "It's H.D.T.&mdash;Hyper-Degenerate-Thorium&mdash;the
stuff the destroyers use to get
extra push."</p>

<p>Mantor roared his glee. "Pack
it aboard, boys&mdash;<i>all</i> of it! And
put it where it will be handy,
just in case."</p>

<p>This was it, Lee thought as she
stood by, watching&mdash;the final
bitter pill. Mantor had as much
as told them he was working for
Venus. And the H.D.T. was all
Venus needed to be ready for war&mdash;a
war that might well blast
civilization from the Solar System.
Strange that so much should
depend upon one man; tragic that
the one man was a weakling.</p>

<p>With an effort Lee forced herself
to be fair. It might have done
no good to lie, she conceded. But
anyone with even a normal
amount of simple courage would
have tried.</p>

<p>It was about two hours later
when the siren went off again like
a banshee wailing to a low-hanging
moon. Men came running
from all directions, shouting questions
at the tops of their voices.</p>

<p>A midget auto came skidding
down the pirate ship's ramp, its
driver standing on the accelerator.
The car knifed through the swirling
crowd, barely missing several
people, and skidded to a dusty
stop directly in front of Mantor.</p>

<p>"<i>Radar signal!</i>" the driver
yelled. "The search receiver
picked up a signal that sounds like
a destroyer's radar. It suddenly
came in strong. Probably sneaked
up on us from behind that damn
moon. It's coming in fast and
braking hard!"</p>

<p>There was a mad scramble as
the looters raced for their ship.
Heavy-handed horseplay was forgotten.
They knew they were
helpless against a Navy destroyer.
Their only hope lay in a fast
getaway. Seconds could easily
spell the difference between safety
and defeat.</p>

<p>In less than ten minutes the
ship's locks were sealed and they
fired off. As the flames roared
out and the huge ship lifted
swiftly it was obvious that they
were throwing on all the fuel
their jets could take.</p>

<p>Marc Polder had faded back
into the crowd at the first sound
of the siren. As he stood watching
the blastoff Lee joined him,
hands in her pockets, looking
more than ever like a boy.</p>

<p>"Maybe my idea of asking for
help wasn't so far-fetched," she
said quietly. "Maybe the patrol
might have been here in time.
Maybe you wouldn't have had to
tell them about the H.D.T."</p>

<p>"Maybe," Marc answered without
turning his eyes from the
dwindling point of reddish light
high in the dark sky.</p>

<p>"And just by way of keeping
the record straight," the girl went
on in a voice that began to rasp,
"you know as well as I do that
the files don't list any H.D.T.
It's under a code name."</p>

<p>"Maybe," Marc replied in a
noncommittal tone.</p>

<p>The point of light in the sky
suddenly turned blue. Lee was
staring at it too, now. And she
knew also what the change of
color meant. Mantor had started
to use the new fuel!</p>

<hr />

<p>Suddenly there was a blinding
flash. Lee cried out and staggered
back, covering her eyes. Marc,
who had closed his eyes when the
color change came, took hold of
the girl's arm.</p>

<p>"I told you what would happen
if they used the stuff," he said
gently. "It's too hot for their jet
chambers. It melts the walls. A
lot of gas piles up in the tubes.
The pressure pushes the fire back.
And when it gets shoved back into
the recoil chamber and you lose
the protective layers of cold gas
there&mdash;well, then you've got to
look for your ship with an
ionization gauge!</p>

<p>"I told you all that long ago.
The trouble is, you're too idealistic,
Lee. That's not the same as
<i>having ideals</i>. I admire ideals&mdash;I
might even confess to a few of
my own. But <i>you</i> don't stop to
figure out just what your ideals
are&mdash;exactly what you're fighting
for.</p>

<p>"You come to a crisis like this
one and you forget about the <i>big</i>
goal. All you see is this one
problem. And by giving them yes-or-no
answers&mdash;good or bad,
brave or cowardly&mdash;to the problem
of the moment&mdash;you may
miss a simple solution to the big
one.</p>

<p>"You've got to keep a cool
head and never forget for even a
moment exactly what it is you
want to accomplish." His voice
was gentle, and it held no rebuke.</p>

<p>"All right," said Lee unhappily,
"you win. You needn't
bother to rub in the salt. I was
going to chase you through all
the inquiry courts for this. Instead,
you got a lucky break, so I can't
do a thing. You ought to be
tarred and feathered through
every city of the Federation, but
because a destroyer happened to
stumble in here at the right time
you'll end up a hero." Her voice
caught in a sob.</p>

<p>"Oh, the destroyer," Marc replied.
"Ah, yes, that <i>was</i> lucky,
wasn't it? The only hitch is&mdash;there
wasn't any destroyer. Probably
not one within a million
miles!" He laughed as Lee turned
surprise-widened eyes toward him.</p>

<p>"What they thought was a
destroyer was the radar system on
the side of the rock, bouncing a
signal off the moon. I gave the
radar boys the word just before
Mantor dropped in on us. The
crew did a damned good job of
juggling the power and frequency
and all." He grinned. "Remind
me to buy them a beer sometime."</p>

<p>He laughed then at the girl's
expression as it changed from
bitter disillusion to something akin
to awe, close to hero-worship.</p>

<p>"And this, by the way," Polder
said, "is as good a time as any to
tell you that I'd like to see you
look like a woman, for a change.
How about changing into a dress
before we go into town. You
know, I've never seen you out of
that uniform?"</p>

<p>She hesitated, unsure of herself
now. "That will take a little
time," she said doubtfully.</p>

<p>He put hands on her slim
shoulders, gave her a gentle shove
toward her quarters. "We've got
time," he told her. "Lots of it.
But I've been waiting quite
a while."</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
